Questions and hints:

1) The company must decide how many of each type of charger to install in order to serve as many cars as possible per day.   Exhibit 1 lists many different types of chargers, but which ones provide the best "bang for the buck"?  The ones selected have to be rapid charging, so most of the ones in the exhibit can be eliminated. Once these have been selected -- what is the upper bound on the number of cars that can be charged each day for each type selected?
    - type 7 and 9.
2) What are the decision variables in this problem?
    - which type of chargers.
    - number of cars charged.

3) What is the objective function?
    - maximize coverage
        - minimize cost (budget minimizing).
    - budget is not binding.

4) Exhibit 2 mainly seems to be providing background information -- is there information which is essential which is not discussed in exhibits 3 and 4?
    - scaling at the current moment.

5) Exhibits 3 and 4 provide the information that is required to identify (estimate) the demand for charging along each highway segment, as well as the demand that is met by the existing charging stations.  NOTE THAT the assumptions under Exhibit 4 are very important.
    - 

AADF (Average Annual Daily Flow) is a very rough estimate of traffic flow, but shockingly, this is what we use in the US, the UK and in most other places (despite excellent technologies to measure flows).

6) Use the AADF and the maximum number of vehicles served per day, along with the number of existing chargers on each segment to calculate the number of additional chargers needed.

7) Is the constraint on the budget mentioned in the case study?  Is this a binding constraint?
