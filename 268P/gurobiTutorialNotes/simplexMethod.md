- problem statement:
    - objective function:
        - 45x1+80x2.
    - 5x1+20x2 <= 400
    - 10x1+15x2 <= 450
- standard form:
    - objective function:
        - 45x1+80x2.
    - 5x1+20x2 + h1 == 400
    - 10x1 + 15x2 == 450

- x1 = 0, x2 = 0, h1 = 400, h2 == 450 is a basic feasible solution
- x1 = 0, x2 = 30, h1 = -200, h2 = 0 is a basic infeasible solutions because it violates the non negativity constraint.
    - this means in order to build 30 tables we need extra capacity of 200 units of mahogany.

- LP problem in canonical form wrt basic variables
- objective function:
    - max z = 45x1 + 80x2 + 0h1 + 0h2
- h1 = 400 - 5x1 - 20x2 is unused mahogany
- h2 = 450 - 10x1 - 15 x2 is unused labor
- x1, x2, h1, h2 >= 0 non-negativity
