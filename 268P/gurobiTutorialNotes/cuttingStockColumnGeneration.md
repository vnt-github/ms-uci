- issues with column relaxation
    - the number of patterns increases with stock size.
    - the nubmer of demands can also make this solution infeasible.

- the number of columns can be huge.
- we want to find which cut pattern we need to restrict our patterns to.

- restricted master problem:
    - use the simplest patterns.
