- critique of approach
- advantages
    - localized failure for a subnet cluster server isolates on cluster failure from other.

- limitations    
    - the initial time to create replica can be time consuming, especially large file. Where as in client-server it would be lesser.
    - in larger subnet the same problems arise as locality of data again becomes bottleneck.
    - may be need  to be heirarchally implemented
    - adds administrative and maintainance to make sure the cluster are in sync.
    - the failed subnet cluster will need to reinit and reconcile all the client sessions files before disconnecion. which is quite complex.
    - NOT SUITABLE FOR DISTRIBUTED WRITE HEAVY SYSTEMS:
        - a file can only be modified by a single cluster at a time, this cluster being denoted the owner of the file.
