- [ ] use multip processing for better performance.
- [ ] use GPU for the processing.
- [ ] MISD for fault tolerance.
- [ ] explore blockchain architecture(crypto currency) or p2p architecture to implement both in 230P and 295P. 
    - [ ] P2P: Napster to BitCoin 
- [ ] 230P will use hadoop so see how to use hadoop here too.
- [ ] watch 3rd lecture.


whats to do?
whats the preference of 295P how to match the 230P?

- timelines and deadlines

- friday 230P 

- go through the 230P requirements and slides.

230P friday extra session.

how to get started.






- 295 hater discussion.
    - 230P which part.
        - projects topics.

- why can't we use the both.
    - the larger the l = 2 paths the lesser likely so can't we just the inverse of it.
        - CRS does and it fails.
    - or use in combination.
    - the doesn't it mean we can test for odd length paths.

    - doesn't the interaction of protein depend more on the physical structure.
        - if its symmetric then the l2 is good.
