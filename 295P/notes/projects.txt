- actual result by week 2-3
- public competetion
	- results published publically
- week 6-7 review


- there would be metrics fixed

projects
ELLIOT
- linear algeaby calculation
	- all encumpsing calculation
	- add to spreadsheet
	- vectorization in backend
	- eigenvalue.com etc but centralized

	- inverting is not trivial
	- matrix of any size is difficult
	- test cases added
	- code evaluated on the memory and cpu efficiency
	- https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2015%20NU13


- astriod impact predictor TOO DIFFICULT
	- physics simulation
	- data available publically at NASA db

TREVOR JONES
- ml/deep learning + sports
	- moneyball AI.
	- historical sports data.
	- fifa bots arn't
	- https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

- anahita
	- ml stock price predictor model
	- gather data
		- yahoo finance
		- professor have
	- find if some stocks predictble then others
	- professor did the for 15 years
		- wrote scrapper to get quotes.
	- stock pickers exist
		- million people doing it so its impact dimishes.


PROBLEM
- registry of type of data
	- JSON ld for data scrapping would have made easier

KUMAR VAIBHAV
- html generator (vix)



- profs student
- gnome sequencing
	- gnome assembly of the human
	- biologists or machines product sequence
	- where in the gnove couple 500 letters come from 3 billions came from
	- reads is sequence of letter, millions of reads each 500 letters.
	- product the overlap.
	- 1 dimesional problem

	- machine makes error (2-3 are wrong letter)
	- gene duplication event
	- 100 million letter occur twice (similar but differ slightly)

	- distinguish btw correct and wrong.

	- ncbi data available
	- tons of paper available.

- edge prediction model(half is working on it)
	- gnome is same, it's static molecule
		- it's recipy to make protein
	- protein made and do stuff made by gnome
	- 20 thousand diff genes
	- 20 thousand diff types of proteins are made with diff functions.
	- protein interact with each other.
	- oxygen is not supposed to be free
	- so protein protein interaction does this.
	- protein stops working it becomes diseases.

	- protein protein intr is graph with 20K
	- some edges are bogus
	- interactions are difficult to discover

	- false negative is 10%.

	- take exiting data, assume most right
	- can we detect if a particular graph edge is bogus.
	- professor have program to produce table

	- 10 to half mil for data of edge exists or not.
