meetings evaluation: actual progress made, as well as the quality and clarity of the presentation.
"progress": can occasionally include "working very hard but failing to find a solution to a particularly difficult aspect". At that point it's fine to ask for help/guidance

We can use the hater index or sentiment analysis as a part of prediction as and additional factor, and map with the tactical data and CORELEATE THE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.
