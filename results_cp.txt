project elevator
- what is our project?
    - Our project is to create an interactive platform where web developers can experiment and learn about various cyber security threats.
- why did you select this topic?
    - we want to deveope this because,
    - The number of people learning and getting into web development is growing day-by-day and so is the need for secure software development. 
    - the knowledge of cyber security is restricted to a few “experts” as it is not not easily availble or readily accessable.
    - Our solutions would enable developers to proactively learn and write secure code.

- what will we learn.
    - As we deveop our Solution,
    - we will be Setting up various exploitable sandboxed environments and making them accessible from web UI, which will enable us 
    - to learn about Cyber Security in depth.
    - to learn  about how to host and handle sandbox environments.
    - AND
    - we will learn how to deveop a tutorial platform.
    - As we will work in sprints, hence we will also learn about Agile software development practices.
- what will i bring to project.

I have cyber security experience and I am an incoming Application Security Researcher at
Adobe for Summer Internship, So i will participate in the Cyber security aspect of our
project.
Along with that, I have 3+ years of professional experience in Backend Development with
Architecture Design on AWS and GCP, hence I'll also be involved in the backend system
architecture and services design.
