- vector processor and those whose hardware supports the scalar and vector computation and algorithims intrensic(embedded) in them.
    - support the vector data type in the hardware
    - support -> implementing inside the cpu register store vector data type
- nitrd current grand challenges national7963.36
- terra flops(floating points operations) exists but not terra gigahertz
- parallel computing: why art?
    - because it's not a certain defined step which fits all problems

- adrans law
    - size of the problem and the type of problem makes the call
        - for ex: for matrix multiplication the size of the matrix

- hw ntw -> cross bar switch
    - allow pair of ntw to connect if pairs are disconnected

- real life example of normilizations in Adrans law?

- claudia is TA
- start working with questions and solutions
- it's a sequential program

- [ ] gcc -Wall randomDistribution1.c -lm
- [ ] what is the certain tolerance value
- [ ] For each simulation run, you are to compute the time-cumulative average of the access-time for each processor,
    - [ ] and the arithmetic average W¯ (Sc(p, m, d)) of all processors’ time-cumulative averages. 
    - [ ] The timecumulative average of a processor’s memory access at cycle c is defined as the total number of simulated memory cycles c divided by the total number of granted accesses so far(for that particular processor p1, or for all).
        - [ ] here if a processors is starved then the value is say at cycle 2 => 2 / 0;

- [ ] does access time reset if granted access
- [ ] the mue is cycle 0 or cycle 1
- [ ] does the memory requested by a processor change after fullfilment of remain same.
- [ ] TODO: fix the first mean for gaussian distribution.
- [ ] what is the accessed M is less that 6.
- [ ] wrap around in cyclic manner.
- [ ] what is tolerance value.
- [ ] So we have a running averageof the wait time for each processor, then at the end teh average wait time of all processors.
