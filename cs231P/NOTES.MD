- vector processor and those whose hardware supports the scalar and vector computation and algorithims intrensic(embedded) in them.
    - support the vector data type in the hardware
    - support -> implementing inside the cpu register store vector data type
- nitrd current grand challenges national7963.36
- terra flops(floating points operations) exists but not terra gigahertz
- parallel computing: why art?
    - because it's not a certain defined step which fits all problems

- adrans law
    - size of the problem and the type of problem makes the call
        - for ex: for matrix multiplication the size of the matrix

- hw ntw -> cross bar switch
    - allow pair of ntw to connect if pairs are disconnected

- real life example of normilizations in Adrans law?

- claudia is TA
- start working with questions and solutions
- it's a sequential program
