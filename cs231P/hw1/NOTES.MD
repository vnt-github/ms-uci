- [ ] code works?
    - [ ] interpretation of results are concerned
    - [ ] there is no one solution.
    - [ ] compare with peers trends of the plots
    - [ ] make sure that they make sense.

- [ ] one module leads to sequential execution
- [ ] infinite then wait time should be zero
- [ ] curvers should converge to mean value
- [ ] curver should go down.


- [ ] uniform is more noisy.
    - [ ] in normal distrubution there will be more conflicts on moduels requested.
    - [ ] so the random uniform distribution has less conflicts and it's less noisy
