- [ ] it's an illusion that whoe meme is available
- [ ] running program is process
    - [ ] text+data is in the hard drive

- [ ] to share the processors we create the concept of process
    - [ ] so we can save the snapshot for multi processing using context switching

- [ ] process is the data structure which cntains the UAS = stack+heap , data, text

- [ ] min thing to run code code text,  register and call stack
- [ ] thread are part of process.. every process has at lease one thread that executes main function
- [ ] threads of same process share data structure because they are part of same user address structure.

- [ ] linux 300 thread for a processor by default but can be increased.

- [ ] thread 1 and thread 2 of diff processors try to write in same loction then we need a policy.

- [ ] diff threads in same core are like node.js async execution.
- [ ] attr NULL for default value
    - [ ] which processors you want to execute the thread.

- [ ] exit(-1) can do diff handling.
- [ ] daemon or zombie processes?
